### Before Starting

1. Check existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplicating work
2. For major changes, open an issue first to discuss your proposal
3. Ensure your idea aligns with the project's goals

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces for bash)
- Follow bash best practices:
  - Quote variables: `"$variable"`
  - Use `[[ ]]` instead of `[ ]` for conditionals
  - Use meaningful variable names
  - Add comments for complex logic

### Script Standards

- Always use `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Set appropriate error handling
- Validate user inputs
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Maintain backward compatibility

### Security Considerations

- Never hardcode credentials
- Validate all user inputs
- Use secure file permissions
- Handle temporary files safely
- Follow the security patterns in the existing code

## Testing

### Running Tests

1. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   ./test_claude_auto_runner.sh
   ```

2. Run security checks:
   ```bash
   ./security_check.sh
   ```

3. Test your changes manually:
   ```bash
   # Test help output
   ./claude-auto-runner.sh --help
   
   # Test with various options
   ./claude-auto-runner.sh --dangerous --verbose
   ```

### Adding Tests
